	<p>Welcome to my page on programming projects! Although not much is here yet, I'm trying my best to fill it up. If you have any suggestions
	as to what I should try out or make feel free to email me using the link above.</p>
	<h4>These aren't even close to all my projects! See all my projects on my github page, or listed on my LinkedIn page. </h4>

			<p>This site was my first attempt to enter the web development world. I learned from various sources on the internet, mainly 
			learning from Codeacademy then using references to enhance my knowledge. The site is built using HTML, CSS with the Bootstrap framework.</p>
			<p>I am currently learning javascript with some files behind the scenes that contain game experiments, but I currently have no javascript 
			on the site.</p>

		  <div class="col-md-6"><h2>Text Compression Program</h2>
	<p> I learnt all about compression in the course that I took and am currently teaching, CS 240. It is an algorithms and data structures course. I wanted
	to see how compression algorithms are used in the real world. A lot of programs use some variation of Lempel-Ziv which I have coded. But, I decided to look more
	into Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT). I learnt that BWT normally is used with the Move To Front heuristic, Run Length Encoding (preferablly Zero RLE) and some form of 
	entropy encoding. Since I was teaching the course as an ISA (Instructional Support Assistant) I decided to try a code out. This application was the result of that.</p>

		<div class="col-md-6"><h2>Pong Clone</h2>
	<p> Since I haven't had much experience, I felt that making a pong clone would be appropriate to help me get a better feel of C++. Although
it is a pong clone, I am trying to add in extras such as power ups and certain customizations. Will upload my prototype on GitHub soon.</p>
