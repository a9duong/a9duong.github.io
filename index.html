		<p>At the moment, I'm in my 2A term in Honour Computer Science Co-op at the University of Waterloo.</p>
		<p>Although my studies take up a lot of time,
		I am currently learning to use the SFML library with respect to C++ game development. Although I'm fairly new to C++, 
		I hope that continuously immersing myself with projects will help fast track my learning. In my free time, I also am
		learning web design as you can tell from the fairly simplistic design that I have for my website at the moment.</p>
		</div>
		  <div class="col-md-4">
            <h2 id="output">Goals for the future?</h2>
			<p>For the future, I want to further my C++ game development knowledge. So I hope to complete a small game
			(other than pong) in the near future (hopefully something original and not tetris 2.0). I'm also thinking about diving into the
			fast growing world of mobile development, although it will most likely be further in the future.</p>
			<p>After seeing the overwhelming amount of experience with programming languages and various technologies that I need to 
			land a good co-op job I'm planning on spending a lot of my time dedicated to expanding my knowledge of languages such as
			C#, Java, Python and learning various web development languages such as HTML5, CSS, jQuery and hopefully more.</p>

		<p>First off, I just can't help but say that you've made an excellent choice.</p>
		<p>Next, you can go to my "About Me" page to learn more about me, and to contact me. Also, you can look at my Programming Projects page
		to learn what I've been up to.</p>
