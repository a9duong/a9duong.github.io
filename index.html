		<p>At the moment, I'm in my 3A term in Honour Computer Science Co-op at the University of Waterloo.</p>
		<p>Although my studies take up a lot of time,
		I am currently learning to broaden my horizons and learn game development. Although I'm fairly new to game development, 
		I hope that continuously immersing myself with projects will help fast track my learning. In my free time, I also am
		learning web design as you can tell from the fairly simplistic design that I have for my website at the moment.</p>

		  <div class="col-md-4">
            <h2 id="output">Goals for the future?</h2>
			<p>For the future, I want to further my C++ game development knowledge. So I hope to complete a small game
			(other than pong) in the near future (hopefully something original and not tetris 2.0). I'm also currently learning android development which has
			been a lot of fun!</p>
			<p>After seeing the overwhelming amount of experience with programming languages and various technologies that I need to 
			land a good co-op job I'm planning on spending a lot of my time dedicated myself to learning more about anything I can to Computer Science.</p>

		<p>First off, I just can't help but say that you've made an excellent choice.</p>
		<p>Next, you can go to my "About Me" page to learn more about me, and to contact me. Also, you can look at my Programming Projects page
		to learn what I've been up to.</p>
