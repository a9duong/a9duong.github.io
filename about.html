		<div class="col-md-4"><h2>Who I am</h2>
		<p>Hello there, I'm Alexander Duong! As you've probably seen on the home page, I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo in my 2A Term.
		I graduated from the Internation Baccalaureate program in high school, but since it didn't offer Computer Science, I took the initiative to learn everything I could on the internet and combine that knowledge with what I've learned in University. Although I'm a bit late to the party, I'll put in twice the effort to catch up and even get ahead of those around me. The only thing
		in my way is myself.</p>
		<h4>If you want to contact me, you can do so <a href="mailto:a9duong@uwaterloo.ca">here</a>. Or visit my github page <a href="https://github.com/a9duong">here</a>.</h4> 
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4"><h2>Technical Skills</h2>
		<p>These are the skills that are relevant to the field of computer science.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Proficient in Racket and C. (If you haven't heard of Racket, it's a language in the Lisp family)</li>
			<li>Intermediate skill level in C++. I am currently learning to use SFML to improve my object oriented programming skills and learn game design techniques.</li>
			<li>Familiar with Bash/Shell scripting.</li>
			<li>Familiar with Git</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Although my skillset is not as extensive as many of my peers, I am actively trying to find new things to learn and add to this list. If anyone has anyone
		suggestions for me I'd love to hear them! Just send me an e-mail using the e-mail address above.</p>

		  <div class="col-md-4">
            <h2 id="output">Hobbies</h2>
			<p>These are things I do when I'm not studying and I'm not programming (so it's a very limited time).</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Badminton - This is my main sport, and I've been playing it for 8 years. I currently play at the KW Badminton club and work there as a coach</li>
				<li>Magic - I've recently delved into the world of magic (not magic the gathering), mainly card tricks. Although it seems really random it helps
				with presentation skills, interpersonal skills and it's a lot of fun!</li>
				<li>League of Legends - Like many other University CS Students I play League of Legends, I do play other games but League is the one
				I play the most.</li>
			</ul>
